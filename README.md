Do Left-handed People Really Die Young? In this project I used pandas and Bayesian statistics to see if left-handed people actually die earlier than righties.

## Aim
The primary aim of this research was to explore the relationship between left-handedness and birth year, and to determine if there is a significant difference in life expectancy between left-handed and right-handed individuals. This involved analyzing historical data to identify trends in left-handedness over time and applying Bayes' theorem to assess the conditional probabilities of dying at a certain age for left-handed versus right-handed people.

## Methodology
Historical data on left-handedness rates by birth year were analyzed to discern any significant trends. Statistical methods were employed to correlate left-handedness with birth year, and the data was extrapolated to estimate rates beyond the recorded years. Bayes' theorem was then applied to calculate the conditional probabilities of dying at a certain age, given the person's handedness.

## Results
The analysis revealed a pattern in the prevalence of left-handedness across different birth years, with fluctuations over time that warrant further investigation. Using Bayes' theorem, the study provided insights into the life expectancy of left-handed individuals compared to right-handed ones, based on the historical data.

## Conclusion
This research shed light on the historical trends of left-handedness and suggested a potential link between handedness and life expectancy. The findings underscore the importance of considering various factors, including birth year, in studies on handedness and health outcomes.
